Writing a college essay can be one of the most important parts of your application process. Itâ€™s your chance to show who you are beyond grades and test scores.

### Step-by-step tips:

- **Understand the prompt**: Carefully read and analyze what the college is asking.
- **Be personal**: Use your authentic voice and share your story.
- **Edit ruthlessly**: Great essays are rewritten multiple times.

A strong opening hook, a meaningful personal story, and a reflective ending will help you stand out.
