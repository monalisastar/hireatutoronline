Studying for hours doesnâ€™t guarantee better results. Try these **smart study strategies** instead:

- **Pomodoro Technique**: 25-minute focus sessions with short breaks.
- **Active Recall**: Practice retrieving information rather than re-reading.
- **Spaced Repetition**: Review material over increasing intervals.

ðŸ“± Bonus tip: Turn off push notifications during study blocks.
