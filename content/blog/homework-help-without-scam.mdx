### 🚩 Common Signs of a Scam

1. **No reviews or fake testimonials**  
   Look for Trustpilot, Reddit, or Discord community feedback.

2. **Unrealistic guarantees**  
   Sites promising “A+ guaranteed” or “complete in 1 hour” are usually red flags.

3. **No human communication**  
   If you can't speak to a real person or tutor before payment, think twice.

4. **Sketchy payment requests**  
   Beware of random cash apps or demanding full payment before seeing work quality.
